[technology-description]
tur_super_torque_tech= Unlocks 750 °C steam systems, and also unlocks steam converter
tur_extreme_torque_tech= Unlocks 800 °C steam systems
tur_4way_turbine_tech=Unlocks better turbines that can work with higher tempreture steam. Hardened against weather
superheated-condensation-basic-tech=Allows the condensation of superheated steam back to water, at the cost of some power production at 90% efficency
superheated-condensation-advanced-tech= You found some duct tape amoung the scrap piles of fulgora, which turns out to be effective at plugging leaks. Unlocks advanced condensation with 100% return on water
extremeHeat-condensation-advanced-tech= After watching pentapod eggs getting endlessly bred and thrown into the heating tower, you get an idea on how to further improve efficency with extreme pressure steam

#descriptions
[entity-description]
tur_converter_entity=Converts steam to torque or extreme torque. Excess steam is piped out for further use. With space age it can also allow condensation of steam, with some efficency loss
tur_super_turbine_entity=Converts torque into electricity
tur_extreme_turbine_entity=Converts extreme torque into electricity
tur_exchanger_entity=Uses heat energy to turn water into 800 degree steam
tur_exchanger_entity_2=Uses heat energy to turn water into 750 degree steam
tur_4way_turbine_entity=750 degree quad turbine. Does not freeze
tur_8way_turbine_entity=800 degree quad turbine. Does not freeze
