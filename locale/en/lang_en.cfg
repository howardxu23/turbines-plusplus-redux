extremeHeat-condensation-advanced-tech=After watching pentapod eggs getting endlessly laid and thrown into the heating tower, you get an idea on how to further improve efficency with extreme pressure steam. Unlocks Extremely superheated steam reclamation.

#descriptions
[entity-description]
tur_converter_entity=Converts steam to superheated steam or extremely superheated steam. Excess steam is piped out for further use. With Space Age it can also allow condensation of steam, with possible efficency loss.
tur_super_turbine_entity=Converts superheated steam into electricity.
tur_extreme_turbine_entity=Converts extremely superheated steam into electricity.
tur_exchanger_entity=Uses heat energy to turn water into 800 degree extremely superheated steam.
tur_exchanger_entity_2=Uses heat energy to turn water into 750 degree superheated steam.
tur_4way_turbine_entity=750 degree superheated quad turbine. Does not freeze.
tur_8way_turbine_entity=800 degree extremely superheated quad turbine. Does not freeze.
